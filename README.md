This was my first ever coding project and I ended up getting 100% on it. This is the game calculation here is a video describing how to play the [game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmwfCE88L50)
Instead of picking a random card for each draw my instructor told us to have the player choose the card which can be done by choosing a number in an array from 1 through 52. To place it on a pile you will either F 
for foundation or W for waste then the pile number right after for example if you want to play one wase pile 1 it would be W1 or foundation pile 4 it would be F4.
